## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I first started this project in september, and I had decided to give up on it after spending more than ten days on it (struggle with Flexbox).
At the end of October, I decided to give myself a second chance, and to start over. I completed the challenge in less than a day.
As this is the first challenge I've done, I think I learned to be patient with myself, and to not give up (as cheesy as it may sound).

I struggled with flexbox and media queries, so I am quite proud of the final result.

```css
body {
    background-image: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    body {
        background-image: url(images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
        background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
    }
}
```

### Continued development
In future projects I want to focus on:
- using Flexbox (and Grid)
- being comfortable with layouts
- being comfortable with media queries (and responsive designs)

### Useful resources

- Flexbox Froggy (https://flexboxfroggy.com) - This game helped me recall the differents CSS properties to place properly the HTML elements using Flexbox.
